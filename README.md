Calculator is an application developed in Python using the Tkinter library, which provides an intuitive graphical interface for performing basic mathematical operations. Our application allows users to conveniently and quickly solve mathematical expressions, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, using clear and easy-to-use graphics.

The main features of the program include:
Interactive Interface: The calculator provides an interactive text box where users can enter their mathematical expressions using numeric buttons and operators.

Accuracy and Precision: With functionality using the built-in eval() function, users receive precise results of their actions, which is especially important for floating point operations.

Data Validation: The program includes a validation mechanism for input data to ensure the correctness of expressions and avoid unwanted errors.

Code Cleanliness: The source code is carefully commented, making it easy to understand the application logic and facilitating possible modifications and development of functionality.

Responsiveness: The interface adapts to different screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience across devices.

Calculator is a project that can be used as a starting point for developing more advanced applications or for learning to program graphical interfaces in Python. With its clear interface and functionality, the program is a useful tool for those looking for a quick and convenient way to perform simple mathematical operations.
